Hopefully I have merged these properly!

The final version should have ASCII art on 
lines 7 and 65.

I wasn't able to use the push command from the command line.
It gave me an error message about remote password access not being
available since 2021.  So most of what I did was through the github
website and desktop app.  That was useful anyway.

I did generally find the documentation for this task a bit confusing.
I wasn't always sure when I was meant to be creating repos, files etc,
or if I was just to be imagining/theorising about them.


Thanks!


Adam
